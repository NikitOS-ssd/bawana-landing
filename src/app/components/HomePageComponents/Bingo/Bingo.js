        The popular Bingo lottery is now available for 1xBet players as well. It follows the same rules as any other bingo familiar from childhood: numbers are randomly selected, which the player needs to cross out on his card. In the online version of the card, filling occurs in auto mode. The player can eventually close a certain number of lines or collect the whole field.
