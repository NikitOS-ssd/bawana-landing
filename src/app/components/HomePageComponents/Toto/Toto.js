        Bwanabet offers players six types of TOTO. This is a coupon with fixed events. You need to guess either the outcome or the exact score. To do this, you need to put “ticks” next to the options you are interested in. Then press “Make Bet.” It is ready!

        Your bet will be calculated after the end of the last event. To win, you need to guess a certain number of outcomes. For example, 2 of 8 or 9 of 15.

        Do you want to test your prediction talent for free? The betting company offers 1xTOTO. It presents 12 events from the world of sports. Next to each, you can choose only one outcome: P2, X or P1. If you guess 12 products, you get 10,000 bonus points in your account. For them, you can buy a free bet on sports in the store (shop window). However, you will have to confirm your free prediction with one real deal.      </p>
